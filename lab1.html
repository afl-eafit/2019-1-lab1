      <h1 style="text-align:center;">Programming Lab 1: Converting Non-Deterministic Finite Automata to Deterministic Finite Automata</h1>
      <h3>TA: Alejandro Murillo G.</h3>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>While non-deterministic finite automata and deterministic finite automata describe languages differently, both actually represent the same type of languages, the "regular languages" [Hopcroft, Motwani and Ullman
    2007]. The goal of this programming lab is to convert NFAs to DFAs to show that both of them are equally powerful.</p>
      <h3>Assignment (80%)</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p>Download the<a href="https://github.com/"> GitHub </a> repository <a href="https://github.com/afl-eafit/2019-1-lab1">2019-1-lab1</a>.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>(70%) Using the data types in the above repository define a function:</p>
            <pre> nfa2dfa :: FiniteAutomata state symbol -&gt; FiniteAutomata (Set state) symbol
</pre>
            <p>that takes a non-deterministic finite automaton and returns a deterministic finite automaton that defines the same language.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            (10%)
            <ul>
               <li>Your lab will be tested using the <code>-Wall</code>, <code>-Wmissing-local-signatures</code> and <code>-Wmissing-signatures</code> options.</li>
               <li>Annotate (in English) your source code using <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haddock">Haddock</a>. Documentation should explain your solution for the assignment.</li>
               <li>Improve your implementation with <a href="https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint">HLint</a>.</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>The programming lab may either be solved on your own, or jointly with one other student taking the course.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>You are to use GHC[i] &ge; 8.6.3.</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Examples</h3>
      <p>Using the <code>FiniteAutomata.hs</code> modules in the above GitHub repository, this is what a sample input-output looks like:</p>
